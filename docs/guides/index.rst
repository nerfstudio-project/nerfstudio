Want to learn more about NeRFs and how they work? You're at the right spot!

Here, we decompose each of the pre-implemented NeRF modules- from how the data's loaded to how the model operates-in an easy to understand way. 
Interact with the notebooks to gain a visual intuition for each component.
Check back in regularly as the technology continues to develop with new modules!
