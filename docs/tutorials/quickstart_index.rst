Neural Volumetric Rendering
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

All-in-one repository for state-of-the-art NeRFs.

nerfactory |:metal:| provides a simple API that allows for a seamless and simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and testing NeRFs.
The library supports a more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.
With more modular NeRFs, not only does your code become far more user-friendly, but using this framework also makes it easier for the community to build upon your implementation.
