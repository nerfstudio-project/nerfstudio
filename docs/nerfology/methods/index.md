# Methods

We provide a set of pre implemented nerfstudio methods.

**The goal of nerfstudio is to modularize the various NeRF techniques as much as possible.**

As a result, many of the techniques from these pre-implemented methods can be mixed ðŸŽ¨.

## Running a method

It's easy!

```bash
ns-train {METHOD_NAME}
```

To list the available methods run:

```bash
ns-train --help
```
