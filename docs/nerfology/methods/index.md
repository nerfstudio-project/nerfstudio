# Methods

We provide a set of pre implemented nerfstudio methods. 

**The goal of nerfstudio is to modularize the various NeRF techniques as much as possible.** 

As a result, many of the techniques from these pre-implemented methods can be mixed ðŸŽ¨.

## Running a method

It's easy!

```bash
ns-train {METHOD_NAME}
```

To list the available methods run:

```bash
ns-train --help
```

## Guides

In addition to their implementations, we have provided guides that walk through each of these method.
