    Fields that are not Tensors will not be batched unless they are also a TensorDataclass.
    Any fields that are dictionaries will have their Tensors or TensorDataclasses batched, and
    dictionaries will have their tensors or TensorDataclasses considered in the initial broadcast.
    Tensor fields must have at least 1 dimension, meaning that you must convert a field like torch.Tensor(1)
    to torch.Tensor([1])
