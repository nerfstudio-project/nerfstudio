# Quickstart

The quickstart will help you get started with the default vanilla nerf trained on the classic blender lego scene.
For more complex changes (e.g. running with your own data/ setting up a new NeRF graph, please see our [docs](https://plenoptix-pyrad.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/quickstart/quick_tour.html).

#### 1. Installation: Setup the environment

This repository is tested with CUDA 11.3. Make sure to install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) before preceding.

<details>
<summary>Installing Conda</summary>

    This step is fairly self-explanatory, but here are the basic steps. You can also find countless tutorials online.

    ```
    cd /path/to/install/miniconda

    mkdir -p miniconda3
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    bash miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p miniconda3
    rm -rf miniconda/miniconda.sh
    ```

</details>

```
# Create the python environment
conda create --name pyrad python=3.8.13
conda activate pyrad

# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:plenoptix/pyrad.git

# Install dependencies
cd pyrad
pip install -r environment/requirements.txt

# Install pyrad as a library
pip install -e .

# Install library with CUDA support. Change setup.py to `USE_CUDA = True` and then
python setup.py develop

# Install tiny-cuda-nn (tcnn) to use with the graph_instant_ngp.yaml config
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch

# Run the test cases
pytest tests
```

#### 2. Getting the data

Download the original [NeRF dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/128yBriW1IG_3NJ5Rp7APSTZsJqdJdfc1) and unfold it in the following format. This is for the blender dataset type. We support the major datasets and allow users to create their own dataset, described in detail [here](docs/tutorials/data_setup.rst).

```
|â”€ pyrad/
   â”œâ”€ data/
   |  â”œâ”€ blender/
   |     â”œâ”€ fern/
   |     â”œâ”€ lego/
         ...
      |- <dataset_format>/
         |- <scene>
         ...
```

#### 3. Training a model

To run with all the defaults, e.g. vanilla nerf method with the blender lego image

```
# Run a vanilla nerf model.
python scripts/run_train.py

# Run a faster version with instant ngp using tcnn (without the viewer).
python scripts/run_train.py --config-name=graph_instant_ngp.yaml

# Run with the viewer. However, you'll have to start the viewer server first. (See the docs.)
python scripts/run_train.py --config-name=graph_instant_ngp.yaml viewer.enable=true
```

With support for [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/), you can run with other configurations by changing appropriate configs defined in `configs/` or by setting flags via command-line arguments.

#### 4. Visualizing training runs

We support multiple methods to visualize training, the default configuration uses Tensorboard. More information on logging can be found [here](https://plenoptix-pyrad.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tooling/logging.html).

<details>
<summary>Real-time Viewer</summary>

We have developed our own Real-time web viewer, more information can be found [here](https://plenoptix-pyrad.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tooling/viewer.html). This viewer runs during training and is designed to work with models that have fast rendering pipelines.

To enable add the following to your config:

```
viewer:
  enable: true
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Tensorboard</summary>

If you run everything with the default configuration we log all training curves, test images, and other stats. Once the job is launched, you will be able to track training by launching the tensorboard in `outputs/blender_lego/vanilla_nerf/<timestamp>/<events.tfevents>`.

```
tensorboard --logdir outputs

# or the following
export TENSORBOARD_PORT=<port>
bash environment/run_tensorboard.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Weights & Biases</summary>

We support logging to weights and biases, to enable add the following to the config:

```
logging:
    writer:
        WandbWriter
```

</details>

#### 5. Rendering a trajectories during inference

```
python scripts/run_eval.py --method=traj --traj=spiral --output-filename=output.mp4 --config-name=graph_instant_ngp.yaml trainer.resume_train.load_dir=outputs/blender_lego/instant_ngp/2022-07-07_230905/checkpoints
```

#### 6. In-depth guide

For a more in-depth tutorial on how to modify/implement your own NeRF Graph, please see our [walk-through](https://plenoptix-pyrad.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tutorials/creating_graphs.html).
